### ***How to Get Started***

The objective of the game is to flip over the most pairs.
The first player will flip over two cards, one card at a time.  If the cards are not the of the same House, they are flipped back over and play moves to the next player.  If the cards flipped are the same House, the pair is kept, and the player gets to go again. Players continue to take turns until all the cards have been matched.
